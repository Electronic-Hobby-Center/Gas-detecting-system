# Gas-detecting-system
The MQ-2 Gas Sensor module is useful for gas leakage detecting in home and industry.

How it works ?

--> A gas sensor is a device which detects the presence or concentration of gases in the atmosphere. Based on the concentration of the gas the sensor produces a corresponding         potential difference by changing the resistance of the material inside the sensor, which can be measured as output voltage.
